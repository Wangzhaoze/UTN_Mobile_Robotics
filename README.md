This is an online course of topic mobile robots of University of Technology Nuremberg which strated in November. The course mainly introduces the kinematics model of mobile robots, Bayesian probability model, the localization based on lidar and wheel odometry with the help of particle filtering, and finally realizes real-time mapping of two-dimensional scenes through FastSLAM. All these knowledge are simulated and verified on a robot simulation platform [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/), which is of great help to understand the various formulas and concepts in the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) of mobile robots.
