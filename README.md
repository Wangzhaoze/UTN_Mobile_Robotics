This is an online course of topic mobile robots of University of Technology Nuremberg which strated in November 2022. The course mainly introduces:
- Kinematics model of mobile robots and Lidar
- Bayesian probability model
- Localization based on Lidar and wheel odometry with the help of [Particle Filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter#:~:text=Particle%20filters%2C%20or%20sequential%20Monte,processing%20and%20Bayesian%20statistical%20inference.)
- [Fast_SLAM](http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/montemerlo.fastslam-tr.pdf).

All these knowledge are simulated and verified on a robot simulation platform [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/), which is of great help to understand the various formulas and concepts in the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) of mobile robots. Thanks to Prof.Wolfram Burgard and other teaching assistants, the reference solutions of exercises and slides are provided by them.


## 2. Webots Simulator
If you have not yet installed the [Webots Simulator](https://cyberbotics.com/), please do so. We recommend the latest version, 2022b, however, you can also use version 2022a if that works better on your system. Then, follow the [official tutorial](https://cyberbotics.com/doc/guide/tutorials) to learn the basics of the simulator.

#### 3.1  Locomotion and Lidar

- In this assignment, you will use the Webots simulator to control a Pioneer 3-DX robot. First, you are asked to implement a differential drive controller using the formulas you learned in this module. Second, you have to use the robotâ€™s LiDAR to find the closest surface and navigate to it. Finally, you will devise and implement a wall-following algorithm. Before starting with the actual assignment, you should read and follow the instructions in the Preliminaries section in order to familiarize yourself with the simulator.

#### 3.2  Bayes Filter

- Consider a household robot equipped with a camera. It operates in an apartment with two rooms: a living room and a bedroom. The robot runs an artificial neural network that can recognize a living room in the camera image. Further, the robot can perform a switch-room action, i.e., it moves to the living room if it is in the bedroom, and vice versa. Neither the recognition nor the motion controller is perfect. 
    
- From previous experience, you know that the robot succeeds in moving from the living room to the bedroom with a probability of 0.7, and with a probability of 0.8 in the other direction. The probability that the neural network indicates that the robot is in the living room although it is in the bedroom is given, and the probability that the network correctly detects the living room is given.

- Unfortunately, you have no knowledge about the current location of the robot. However, after performing the switch-room action, the neural network indicates that the robot is not in the living room. After performing the switch-room action for the second time, the network again indicates not seeing a living room. Use the Bayes filter algorithm to compute the probability that the robot is in the bedroom after performing the two actions.
