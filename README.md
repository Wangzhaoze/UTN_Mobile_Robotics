This is an online course of topic mobile robots of University of Technology Nuremberg which strated in November 2022. The course mainly introduces:
- Kinematics model of mobile robots and Lidar
- Bayesian probability model,
- Localization based on Lidar and wheel odometry with the help of [Particle Filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_filter#:~:text=Particle%20filters%2C%20or%20sequential%20Monte,processing%20and%20Bayesian%20statistical%20inference.)
- [Fast_SLAM](http://robots.stanford.edu/papers/montemerlo.fastslam-tr.pdf).

All these knowledge are simulated and verified on a robot simulation platform [Webots](https://cyberbotics.com/), which is of great help to understand the various formulas and concepts in the Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) of mobile robots. Thanks to Prof.Wolfram Burgard and other teaching assistants, the reference solutions of exercises and slides are provided by them.
